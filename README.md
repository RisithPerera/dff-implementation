# Deep Frequency Filtering for Domain Generalization

This repository contains an implementation of the Deep Frequency Filtering (DFF) method for domain generalization. DFF improves the robustness of deep neural networks across different domains by selectively filtering frequency components in the latent space.

## Overview

Domain generalization is essential when models are trained on data from certain domains but must perform well on unseen ones. The DFF method leverages the frequency domain to filter out domain-specific details while preserving general, transferable features. This is achieved through:
- **Frequency Transformation:** Converting spatial features to the frequency domain via FFT.
- **Selective Attention:** Learning instance-adaptive masks to modulate frequency components.
- **Two-Branch Architecture:** Combining original spatial features with frequency-filtered features.

## Original Paper

For more details on the method, please refer to the original paper:  
[Deep Frequency Filtering for Domain Generalization](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/papers/Lin_Deep_Frequency_Filtering_for_Domain_Generalization_CVPR_2023_paper.pdf)

## Features

- **Global Frequency Filtering:** Uses FFT to obtain a global view of frequency components.
- **Selective Attention:** Applies a 1Ã—1 convolution, batch normalization, and ReLU to create an adaptive spatial mask.
- **Efficient Architecture:** The latent space is smaller than the raw input, reducing computational cost while retaining essential information.

## Requirements
